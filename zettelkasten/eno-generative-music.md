Eno distinguishes between "contemplative" and "generative" art — art that generates itself according to rules vs art that is fixed. Generative systems produce emergence: the composer sets up conditions, not outcomes.

The composer recedes; the system takes over. Resonates with LeWitt's instruction-based conceptual art.
