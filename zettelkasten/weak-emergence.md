Bedau distinguishes weak emergence (in principle reducible but computationally intractable) from strong emergence (irreducible in principle). Most emergence observed in natural systems is weak.

The macro-level pattern is derivable from micro-level rules, but only by simulation — there is no shortcut. The simulation *is* the explanation.

Connects to Anderson: the breakdown of reductionism in practice, even if not in principle.
