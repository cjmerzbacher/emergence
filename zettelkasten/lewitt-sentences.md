LeWitt establishes that the concept precedes execution — the work is the set of instructions, reproducible by anyone. The artist is the architect of a system, not the hand that executes it.

Connection to emergence: the instructions are the micro-level rules; the artwork is the macro-level pattern. The instructions cannot predict the aesthetic outcome.
